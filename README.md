This respository includes python functions for my research works on stochastic models of cellular biology. 

The functions are listed below:

1. Deterministic ODE solvers for NFkB/IkB signaling pathway models 

2. Power Spectrum analysis functions for the stochastic dynamics of time series

3. Limit cycle dynamics of oscillatory systems. 

4. Stochastic differential equation solver.

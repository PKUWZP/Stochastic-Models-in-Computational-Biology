This respository includes python and C++ functions for my research works on stochastic models of cellular biology. 

The functions are listed below:

1. Deterministic ODE solvers for NFkB/IkB signaling pathway models (<span style="color:red"> Det_Models_GeneNetwork.py </span>) 

2. Power Spectrum analysis functions for the stochastic dynamics of time series (<span style="color:blue"> PowerSpectrum.py </span>

3. Limit cycle dynamics of oscillatory systems. (<span style="color:green"> LimitCycle.py </span>

4. C++ Stochastic differential equation solver (<span style="color:#00ff00"> nfkb_decoy_strip.cpp </span>).

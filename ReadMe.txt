This repository contains python and C++ codes for stochastic simulations of gene regulatory networks of the NF\kappa B I\kappa B system. 

1. nfkb_decoy_strip.cpp (the C++ code implementing Monte Carlo Simulations of Gene Regulatory Networks)

2. Det_Models_GeneNetwork.py (the Python code implementing the deterministic ODE models for Gene Regulatory Networks)

3. LimitCycle.py (the Python code to plot limit cycles of the nonlinear dynamical system)

4. PlotDensity.py (the Python code to plot probability density functions)

5. PowerSpectrum.py (the Python code to plot the Power Spectrum of Signals)

6. input_nfkb.txt (the input file for nfkb_decoy_strip.cpp which contains initial parameters)

7. Makefile (the makefile in the Linux system)

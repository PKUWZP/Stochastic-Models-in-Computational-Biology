This respository includes python and C++ functions for my research works on stochastic models of cellular biology. 

The functions are listed below:

1. Deterministic ODE solvers for NFkB/IkB signaling pathway models ( **Det_Models_GeneNetwork.py**) 

2. Power Spectrum analysis functions for the stochastic dynamics of time series (**PowerSpectrum.py** )

3. Limit cycle dynamics of oscillatory systems. (**LimitCycle.py**)

4. C++ Stochastic differential equation solver (**nfkb_decoy_strip.cpp**).
